Closures
-------
Python Closures are these inner functions that are enclosed within the outer function.
Closures can access variables present in the outer function scope.
It can access these variables even after the outer function has completed its execution.

expample code:
--------------
def outer(name):
    def inner():
        print(name)
    return inner

myFunction = outer('TechVidvan')
myFunction()


other example:
--------------
def sum(num):
    def add(x):
        return num + x
    return add
print(sum(12)(5))



When and Why do you need to use Closures in Python?
---------------------------------------------------
To implement data hiding: The only way to access the enclosed function is by calling the enclosing function. 
There is no way to access the inner function directly.
